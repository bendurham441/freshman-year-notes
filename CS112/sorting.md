# Sorting Algorithms

When implementing such algorithms, it often pays to make use of [[generics]] in order to keep to the DRY best practice.

1. Bubble Sort
   - Idea:
     1. Loop through each pair of items in a list
     2. Compare each pair of items
     3. If items are out of order, switch them
     4. Continue looping over pairs
   - Takes a maximum of n - 1 times
   - Every iteration, an item is put into the right place
     - "Latches on" to the next highest value each times
   - After kth iteration, last k items are in order and in the correct spot
2. Insertion Sort
   - Idea:
     1. Go item by item
     2. Compare each item to item(s) before it
     3. If item is smaller than item before it, check the item before that
     4. Insert the item in the correct place
     5. Repeat the process for all but the last item in the list
   - Takes a maximum of n - 1 times
   - After the kth iteration, the first k numbers are ordered but not necessarily in the correct spot
3. Selection Sort
   - Idea:
     1. Loop through each item
     2. Check all items to the right of the given item for the smallest item
     3. Swap the items if necessary
   - After kth iteration, the first k numbers are ordered and in the correct spot
