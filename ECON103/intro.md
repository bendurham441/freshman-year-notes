# What is Economics

## Definition

- Study of the allocation of scare resources that have alternative uses (not all encompassing definition because it leaves out people)
- More broadly: study of people and their choices
  - choices seeking money, power, etc.

## Distinction from psychology

- Psychology focuses on the motivations + causes while econ is principally concerned with societal consequences (market outcomes)
  - Markets dictate society's ability to make choices
  - Observations about a specific market often generalize

## What is a market

  - includes exchanges of goods/ideas
  - relationships and classes are examples of markets
