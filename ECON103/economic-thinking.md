# The Economic way of Thinking

Can sometimes seem counterintuitive

1. Incentives
   - Reasons for doing something
     - intrinsic
     - extrinsic
   - These reasons invoke action
   - Incentives can be used to justify otherwise "strange" behavior
   - People have different incentives, prompting different choices
   - Can be useful to think selfishly when examining incentives
     - Who benefits from a choice/policy?
     - Why would they make this choice/policy
2. Scarcity
   - Limitations on resources
   - No scarcity would mean no economy because there would be no disagreements about allocation of resources
   - Scarcity is not necessary of physical items
     - Scarcity of time
     - Scarcity of opportunity
3. Subjectivism
   - All value is subjective
   - value is not inherent, cannot be measured
   - **objective doesn't mean true, simply that it is measurable**
   - Labor Theory of Value: **not true**
     - Theory states the value of an item corresponds to time put into it
     - Counterexample: Bobby Cavender makes a meal in 1 hour vs Gordon Ramsay making a meal in 1 hour
4. Opportunity Cost
   - What you give up to do something
   - In a situation where you could get Snickers or M&M's, the opportunity cost of getting the snickers is the value you could have gotten out of the M&M's
   - Often not visible
   - Time, money, and energy are **not** opportunity costs; they are direct costs
   - Benefits often drive decisions more than opportunity cost because they are more visible
   - Example
     - Spending 12 hours "extreme couponing" to get $100 of goods free vs delivering pizzas for 12 hours and getting $150
     - Even if there are benefits of a choice, they could be weighed against the benefits of another potential choice
5. Trade can make everone better off
   - Trade only happens when there is a disagreement on value (usually born from circumstance)
   - No one will trade for something they think is worse than what they are trying to trade
   - Factors such as specialization can allow companies like McDonalds to sell items for prices that people are willing to pay both because they buy in bulk and because they are backed by a large corporation
6. Rational people think on the margin
   - People don't think in totality, but rather in small usable amounts
