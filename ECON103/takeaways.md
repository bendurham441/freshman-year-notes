# Key takeaways from ECON 103

1. The economic problem
   - People want stuff but there isn't enough
   - Based on disagreement
     - No disagreement, no need for economy
     - Agreement means no conflict or problem
   - Disagreement means that choices must be made on who gets what
   - Who gets to make choices? The government? or leave it up to the "free" market
   - How do we reconcile disagreement?
2. Markets
   - Strategy for dealing with scarcity
   - Nobody is in charge, no matter if they claim it
   - People may *try* to control
3. Effects of government policy

These three basic concepts encompass the majority of discourse
