# Property Rights

- ownership
- can reasonably expect no one will take something away
- makes sense for scarce items [see scarcity](economic-thinking.md) since individuals are likely to care for items they own, therefore conserving them
- Typically don't exist on abundant resources (can depend on circumstance)
